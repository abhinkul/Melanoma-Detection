## General Information
This project consists of a multiclass classification model using a custom convolutional neural network in TensorFlow. The target of the model is to detect the type of Melanoma cancer, out of given 9 classes.
The dataset consists of 2357 images of malignant and benign oncological diseases, which were formed from the International Skin Imaging Collaboration (ISIC). All images were sorted according to the classification taken with ISIC, and all subsets were divided into the same number of images, with the exception of melanomas and moles, whose images are slightly dominant.

## Technologies Used
- Coding language: Python
- Platform: Google colab
- Key libraries: tensorflow, keras

## Conclusions
Convolutional Nueral Networks (CNNs) are very effective in classifying images. We can use libraries such as tensorflow and keras to train and compile the model.
